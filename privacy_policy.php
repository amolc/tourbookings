                <p>There is no single global entity that regulates personal information online. Instead, Tour Booking has made a conscious choice to follow the privacy guidelines as established by law in the major markets where we operate and where we have offices. In Australia that means being guided by the <a href="http://www.privacy.gov.au/publications/nppgl_01.html" title="National Privacy Principles" target="_blank">National Privacy Principles</a>. In the United States that means adhering to the Federal Trade Commission's <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/" title="guidelines" target="_blank">guidelines</a>. In Europe that means adhering to EC Directive 95/46/EC and complying with the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data from the European Union.</p>
