                <p>Remember to make a copy, print out or screen shot of the lower rate, in case a Tour Booking customer service representative has questions. Other things you should know about our low-price guarantee, and how to claim your refund:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tour Booking's Low-Price Guarantee is available to any customer who makes a qualifying purchase through the Tour Booking.com web site. Qualifying purchase must include a minimum purchase of US$20 (or equivalent). Please note that show, concert and event tickets are not covered by Tour Booking's Low Price Guarantee.</li>
<br>
<li>Tour Booking's Low Price Guarantee covers retail and prepaid rates available to the general public. This does not include discounts you may receive (or be eligible for) from third-party organizations such as AAA or AARP, or special offers made as part of a membership program, corporate discount, daily deal, group or rewards program.</li>
<br>
<li>If you find a lower retail or prepaid rate for the same tour or activity, offered on the same date and priced in the same currency as your original purchase, on any other Web site within 72 hours following your confirmed reservation on Tour Booking.com, Tour Booking will refund the difference.</li>
<br>
<li>Upon arrival in your destination, if you find a lower retail price offered by Tour Booking's contracted operator for the same tour or activity, offered on the same date and priced in US, Canadian or Australian dollars, British pounds or Euros, Tour Booking will refund the difference.</li>
<br>
<li>To submit a refund request, send an email to <a href="mailto:priceguarantee@Tour Booking.com">priceguarantee@Tour Booking.com</a> with your name, Tour Booking Booking Number or Itinerary Reference Number and your home address, plus proof (receipt, price list, flyer, web address or web screen shot, etc.) of the lower price.</li><br>
