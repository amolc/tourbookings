Malaysia is the abode to Indians, Malays, Chinese, and various other ethnic groups who are living there for many years with peace and harmony. This multiculturalism has made Malaysia truly a beautiful country.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;When I reached to this lively country, I came to know that Malaysians are really relaxed, friendly and calm at heart. They love celebrating socialising. Their customs and ethnicity has made Malaysia a gastronomical ecstasy and a dwell to hundreds of colourful festivals.<br><br>In geographic terms, Malaysia is as varied as it is in its culture with two central territories, Putrajaya and Kuala Lumpur, and eleven states. One of the key attractions, which add contrast to this country, is its theme of â€œDiversityâ€. On one hand lofty skyscrapers look down upon wooden houses, and on the other the five-star hotels are positioned few meters away from prehistoric reefs.<br><br>There are rich and humid mangroves, sandy beaches, tropical rainforests, soaring mountains and cool highlands. Malaysia is the perfect holiday destination for everyone. &nbsp;There are several places in Malaysia to visit, but the top 10 tourist attractions that I found amazing were:<br><br> <b>Langkaw</b>i<br><br>Langkawi is located in the Malaysiaâ€™s north-western coast in the Andaman Sea. It is an archipelago of 99 islands showing splendid mangroves, rainforests, beaches, and forest-clad mountains. Of late several restaurants, resorts, hotels, and other tourist attractions have been developed in Langkawi. These relaxing places put icing on the cake by increasing the marvel of this already-marvellous place.<br><br><b>Gunung Mulu National Park<br></b><br>Eminent for its exceptionally beautiful limestone karst formations and unusual cave systems, the Gunung Mulu National Park is one of the most splendid natural attractions to see in all of Southeast Asia. It is located in Malaysian Borneo in the Sarawak State. This national park features some of the biggest and longest cave systems in the world. The worldâ€™s largest cave chamber called the Sarawak Chamber is the part of these caves. <br> <br><b>Kuching</b><br><br>Kuching is the biggest city on Borneo Island; it is a famous place among tourists because it gives a chance to explore the rainforests of Borneo and the state of Sarawak. However, Kuching proposes ample of things to the tourists to see and do throughout their dwell from seeing the sights, like historic landmarks to full of life markets and out-of-doors amusement.<br><br><b>Kuala Lumpur</b><br><br>Kuala Lumpur was a quiet town 150 years ago, but that same drowsy town has turned into the countryâ€™s federal capital, and the largest metropolis. This vibrant city is the blend of cultures, and is noteworthy for its majestic buildings, nightlife, shopping and dining experience.<br><br><b>Taman Negara</b><br><br>Encircling three states across the northern part of West Malaysia, Taman Negara is apparently known to be the oldest tropical rainforest in the world. Prominent as the adventurous and ecotourism destination, this national park is famous for its rare plants, scant animals and colourful birds, like Sumatran Rhinoceros, Malayan Tiger, and Asian elephant.<br><br><b>Penang</b><br><br>Situated in the Strait of Malacca off West Malaysiaâ€™s north-western coast, Penang Island is a renowned tourist destination owing to its significant Georgetown and rich gastronomic multiplicity. Penangâ€™s location among one of the worldâ€™s most travelled shipping routes has imparted it with a colourful assortment of architecture, cultures, and cuisine.<br><br><b>Kota KinabaluKota </b><br><br>Kinabalu is an emerging traveller destination because of its close nearness to tropical islands, wildlife refuges, rainforests, national parks and Malaysiaâ€™s tallest peak, Mount Kinabalu. It is the capital of the Sabah State in Malaysian Borneo.<br><br><b>Kota Bharu</b><br><br>The capital of Kelantan State, Kota Bharu has time and again being used as a stopover by many travellers. It has always presented its own exceptional charm in its own way in terms of appeal, attractions, shopping and cuisine. It is situated in Peninsular Malaysia near the Thailand border.<br><br><b>Cameron Highlands</b><br><br>Providing a cool flee from the high temperature of the plains, the Cameron Highlands in the Titiwangsa Mountains are one of Malaysiaâ€™s oldest tourist destinations. Urbanized with an English garden appeal, this beautiful tableland offers vivid flower farms, luxuriant scenery, forests, tea plantations, lakes, animals and outdoor amusement. <br><br><b>Melaka</b><br><br>Melaka commands an imperative position on the busy sea route between India and China on West Malaysiaâ€™s south-western coast. Melaka was ruled and encountered over for centuries between Indian, British, Portuguese, and Dutch governments. &nbsp;Consequently this contemporary Malaysian city has now become one of the most excellent places to stopover in Malaysia. Jam-packed with architecture, civilization, customs and food, Melaka itself reflects its rich heritage.<br><br>Well, my trip to Malaysia was fabulous, and definitely I will visit there once again to cover and see the places which I didnâ€™t. Moreover, I also felt that as per the catchphrase of Malaysian tourism department, â€œMalaysia is truly Asiaâ€.
